## Abstract
As a cache eviction algorithm, FIFO has a lot of attractive properties, such as simplicity, speed, scalability, and flash-friendliness. The most prominent criticism of FIFO is its low efficiency (high miss ratio).

In this work, we demonstrate a simple, scalable FIFO-based algorithm with three static queues (S3-FIFO). Evaluated on 6594 cache traces from 14 datasets, we show that S3-FIFO has lower miss ratios than state-of-the-art algorithms across traces. Moreover, S3-FIFO’s efficiency is robust — it has the lowest mean miss ratio on 10 of the 14 datasets and is among the top algorithms on the other datasets. The use of FIFO queues enables S3-FIFO to achieve good scalability with 6× higher throughput compared to optimized LRU at 16 threads.

Our insight is that most objects in Zipf workloads will only be accessed once in a short window, so it is critical to evict them early. And the key of S3-FIFO is a small FIFO queue that filters out most objects from entering the main cache. We show that filtering with a small static FIFO queue has a guaranteed eviction time and higher eviction precision compared to state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms.


## Repo structure 
The repo is a snapshot of [libCacheSim](https://github.com/cacheMon/libCacheSim), modified [cachelib](https://github.com/facebook/cachelib/), and [distComp](https://github.com/1a1a11a/distComp). 


### How to use libCacheSim
You can compile libCacheSim, which will provide a `cachesim` binary, then you can run simulations with
```bash
# compile libcachesim
pushd libCacheSim/scripts && bash install_dependency.sh && bash install_libcachesim.sh && popd;
```

Use cacheSim to run cache simulations

```bash
# ./cachesim DATAPATH TRACE_FORMAT EVICTION_ALGO CACHE_SIZE [OPTION...]
./cachesim DATA oracleGeneral fifo,arc,lecar,s3fifo 0 --ignore-obj-size 1
```
Detailed instructions can be found at [libCacheSim](https://github.com/cacheMon/libCacheSim).

### How to use cachelib
```bash

# generate data 
python3 libCacheSim/scripts/data_gen.py -m 1000000 -n 100000000 --alpha 1.0 --bin-output cachelib/mybench/zipf1.0_1_100.oracleGeneral.bin

git clone https://github.com/Thesys-lab/cachelib-sosp23
cd cachelib/mybench; 
# turnoff turobo boose and change to performance mode, this is very important for getting consistent results
bash turboboost.sh disable;
# build cachelib
bash build.sh; 
# usage: bash run.sh algo size
bash run.sh s3fifo 4000
```

This will generate binaries of different caches under `_build/`. You can then run
```bash
./_build/algo trace size_mb hashpower n_thread
```

### How to use distComp
If you need to scale up the computation by using more nodes, you would need to use distComp. See [here](https://github.com/1a1a11a/distComp) for more details. 


## Instructions for reproducing results (artifact evaluation)
Please see [artifact evaluation](/doc/AE.md) for detailed instructions.


## Traces
The traces we used can be downloaded [here](https://ftp.pdl.cmu.edu/pub/datasets/twemcacheWorkload/cacheDatasets/).

The binary traces are [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) compressed and have the following format:
```c
struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;
    uint64_t obj_id;
    uint32_t obj_size;
    int64_t next_access_vtime;  // -1 if no next access
}
```
The compressed traces can be used with libCacheSim without decompression. And libCacheSim provides a tracePrint tool to print the trace in human-readable format.
